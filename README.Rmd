rOzCBI in a nutshell:

* [OpenDataKit](https://getodk.org/) forms to evaluate a burnt site.
* Helpers to calculate the 
  [OzCBI](https://doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2023.2168400) from the burn grading 
  field data for both forest and heath communities.
* Instructions to get up and running with data capture and data analysis.
* Working examples of the entire data flow.

## What
To evaluate the severity of burns, the differential normalised burn ratio (dNBR)
of a burnt site can be derived from satellite imagery 
cost-effectively and on a large scale. 
The NBR is calculated from NIR and SWIR bands as 
$NBR = (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)$.
The dNBR is calculated from pre- and post-burn NBR as 
$dNBR = NBR_{post} / NBR_{pre}$.
To calibrate the dNBR, ground truthing field work can derive an index
called "OzCBI" from the condition and composition of a burnt site.

rOzCBI contains background, digital data capture, analysis, and
visualisation for the calculation of OzCBI, a composite burn index
for the initial assessment of the short-term burn severity from
remotely sensed data.

OzCBI was derived from GeoCBI, which was first described in 
[De Santis, Angela & Chuvieco, Emilio. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2008.10.011)

OzCBI was further modified to suit Australian vegetation 
communities by Valerie Densmore at DBCA in Western Australia. 
This version of the OzCBI is currently being tested and validated so the 
current version may not reflect the final form. Feedback on the use and validity 
of OzCBI is welcome as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dbca-wa/rOzCBI/issues).

OzCBI has been published as

features in Australian ecosystems, Australian Forestry, 86:1, 1-21, DOI: [10.1080/00049158.2023.2168400](https://doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2023.2168400)


## How
`rOzCBI` supplies an Xform to capture data digitally using OpenDataKit, then
goes on to access the data directly from R using the package `ruODK`, and
provides helper methods to calculate the OzCBI from the captured data.

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("dbca-wa/rOzCBI")
```

The overall data flow from digital form to data analysis is described at 
[ruODK](https://dbca-wa.github.io/ruODK/index.html).

Read vignette 
[Digital Data Capture](https://dbca-wa.github.io/rOzCBI/articles/forms.html) on
the design and setup of the digital data capture form and infrastructure.

Read vignette 
[Data analysis](https://dbca-wa.github.io/rOzCBI/articles/analysis.html) on
access, analysis, and visualisation of the captured burn grading data using 
the GeoCBI assessment method.

Windows users might see the `curl` error `unable to get local issuer certificate`
when using an ODK Central instance with self-signed SSL certificates.
This can be fixed ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54660072/2813717)) 
through the following line:
```{r}
library(httr)
httr::set_config(httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = FALSE))
```
As it decreases security, it is recommended to only run this when necessary.


## Who
The methodology was compiled and adapted to Western Australian vegetation by 
Valerie Densmore (DBCA).

The R package `rOzCBI` was developed, and is maintained, 
by Florian Mayer for the Western Australian 
[Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA)](https://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/).
